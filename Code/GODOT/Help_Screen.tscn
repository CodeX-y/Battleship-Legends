	Game Developed by Yusra, Karol, Bilal, and Darshan
Based off of a command line version by the original creators.

Rules:

	The game is simple and easy to understand for those familiar with the game of battleship, the game involves placing ones ships upon a grid with the intention of strategically positioning them so as to avoid enemy fire. Each player is tasked with attempting to sink their opponents ships and neither player knows precisely where those ships are located on the opposing grid.
	Both players take turns firing upon each others ships and marking off positions on their target grid until they have managed to sink their opponents ships thereby ending the game. There is no turn limit and the game will continue until one player has successfully elimnated all of his opponents ships."
